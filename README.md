## Introduction

### What is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking.

### Brief History and Evolution of Azure

Microsoft Azure was first announced in 2008 as "Project Red Dog" and was officially launched in 2010 as "Windows Azure." The platform has evolved significantly over the years:

- 2010: Initial launch as Windows Azure
- 2014: Renamed to Microsoft Azure
- 2016: Introduction of Azure Stack
- 2018: Launch of Azure Arc
- 2020: Introduction of Azure Synapse Analytics
- 2022: Launch of Azure OpenAI Service

### Who Uses Azure?

Azure's user base includes:

- Enterprise organizations
- Small and medium businesses
- Startups and developers
- Government agencies
- Educational institutions
- Healthcare providers
- Financial services
- Manufacturing companies

### Key Azure Concepts for AZ-900

1. **Resource Groups**
     Resource groups are logical containers that hold related Azure resources for an application. Think of them as folders that help you organize and manage all the resources needed for a specific project or application.

   - **Practical Example:**
     Imagine you're building a web application. Your resource group might contain:
     - A web app (App Service)
     - A database (Azure SQL Database)
     - A storage account for images
     - A virtual network for connectivity

   - **Why are they important?**
     - Organization: Keep related resources together
     - Management: Apply policies and permissions to all resources at once
     - Cost tracking: Monitor spending for specific projects
     - Lifecycle management: Delete all resources together when no longer needed

   - **Documentation Reference:**
     [Azure Resource Groups Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)

2. **Subscriptions**
     Subscriptions are the fundamental unit of billing and access management in Azure. They represent a billing relationship with Microsoft and provide a boundary for resource management.

   - **Practical Example:**
     A company might have different subscriptions for:
     - Development environment
     - Testing environment
     - Production environment

     Each with its own billing and access controls.

   - **Types of Subscriptions:**
     - **Free Trial**: 12 months of free services with $200 credit
     - **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use
     - **Enterprise Agreement**: For large organizations with volume licensing
     - **Student**: Free services for verified students

   - **Documentation Reference:**
     [Azure Subscriptions Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription)

3. **Management Groups**
     Management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. They help you organize subscriptions into containers and apply governance conditions to those containers.

   - **Practical Example:**
     A multinational company might organize their Azure resources like this:

     ```plaintext
     Root Management Group
     ├── North America
     │   ├── Production Subscriptions
     │   └── Development Subscriptions
     ├── Europe
     │   ├── Production Subscriptions
     │   └── Development Subscriptions
     └── Asia
         ├── Production Subscriptions
         └── Development Subscriptions
     ```

   - **Why use them?**
     - Apply policies across multiple subscriptions
     - Manage access control at scale
     - Organize subscriptions by department, environment, or region
     - Implement consistent governance

   - **Documentation Reference:**
     [Azure Management Groups Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview)

4. **Regions and Availability Zones**
   - **What are they?**
     - **Regions**: Geographic areas containing one or more data centers
     - **Availability Zones**: Physically separate data centers within a region

   - **Practical Example:**
     Let's say you're deploying a critical application:

     ```plaintext
     Region: East US
     ├── Availability Zone 1: Primary data center
     ├── Availability Zone 2: Backup data center
     └── Availability Zone 3: Disaster recovery
     ```

     This setup ensures your application remains available even if one data center fails.

   - **Why are they important?**
     - **High Availability**: Deploy resources across multiple zones
     - **Disaster Recovery**: Protect against regional outages
     - **Data Residency**: Meet compliance requirements
     - **Performance**: Choose regions close to your users

   - **Region Pairs**:
     - **What are they?**
       Region pairs are two regions within the same geography that are paired together for disaster recovery and high availability.

     - **Practical Example:**

       ```plaintext
       North America Region Pairs:
       ├── East US
       │   └── West US
       ├── Central US
       │   └── East US 2
       ├── North Central US
       │   └── South Central US
       └── West US 2
           └── West US 3
       ```

     - **Key Benefits**:

### Azure Databases

#### Azure SQL Database

- **What is it?**
  Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security for your applications.

- **What are DTUs?**
  DTUs (Database Transaction Units) are a bundled measure of compute, storage, and I/O resources in Azure SQL Database. They represent a simplified way to understand and purchase database performance. Each DTU includes:
  - Compute resources (CPU)
  - Storage
  - I/O operations
  - Memory

  Note: While DTUs are still available, Microsoft has introduced a newer vCore-based purchasing model that provides more granular control over resources.

- **What are vCores?**
  vCores (virtual Cores) are a more granular way to provision and manage computing resources in Azure SQL Database. Each vCore represents a logical CPU core that can be allocated to your database. This model provides:
  - More precise control over compute resources
  - Better predictability of performance
  - Easier matching with on-premises workloads
  - More flexible scaling options

  The vCore model separates compute resources from storage, allowing you to:
  - Scale compute and storage independently
  - Choose specific hardware generations
  - Select memory configurations
  - Optimize costs based on actual needs

- **Practical Example:**
  An enterprise database:

  ```plaintext
  vCore-based Database:
  ├── General Purpose
  │   ├── 4 vCores
  │   ├── 20 GB RAM
  │   └── Cost: ~$200/month
  ├── Business Critical
  │   ├── 8 vCores
  │   ├── 40 GB RAM
  │   └── Cost: ~$800/month
  └── Hyperscale
      ├── Auto-scaling vCores

#### Azure Cosmos DB

- **What is it?**
  Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides low latency, high availability, and automatic scaling.

- **What are RUs?**
  RUs (Request Units) are the currency of throughput in Azure Cosmos DB. They represent the system resources (CPU, memory, and I/O) required to perform database operations. Each operation (read, write, query) consumes a certain number of RUs based on its complexity. For example:
  - A simple point read of a 1 KB item: ~1 RU
  - A complex query across multiple partitions: ~100+ RUs
  - A write operation: ~5-10 RUs

  RUs are provisioned per second, and you only pay for the RUs you provision. This allows you to scale your database's throughput independently of storage.

- **Practical Example:**
  A global gaming platform:

  ```plaintext
  Cosmos DB Setup:
  ├── Multi-region Write
  │   └── Cost: ~$0.008/100 RUs
