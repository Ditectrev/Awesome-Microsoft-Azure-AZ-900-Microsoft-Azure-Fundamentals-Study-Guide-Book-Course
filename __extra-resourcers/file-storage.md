# File Storage Recording Notes

## Apology for Recording Confusion

During this recording it got a little bit longer of 2 minutes, but still longer than expected. Sorry for that, I confused the fact File Storage can't be accessed via HTTP(S), like Blob Storage. Anyway, I left the recording untouched, it's good for you to see debugging, and why we need Blob Storage. However, I have to apologize for the confusion when I tried to access the file via HTTP(S). I should prepare a bit better before doing the recording, apologizes.

## Key Takeaway

- **File Storage**: Cannot be accessed via HTTP(S)
- **Blob Storage**: Can be accessed via HTTP(S)
- The recording demonstrates real debugging process and explains why Blob Storage is needed for HTTP(S) access
